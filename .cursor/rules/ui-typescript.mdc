## UI and TypeScript Conventions

- **Theming and colors**:
  - Use shadcn/ui for styling and tailwindcss for styling.
  - Match text colors to card backgrounds; avoid hardcoded colors.
  - Use opacity-based utility classes and theme tokens to support light/dark modes.
  - Prefer design tokens/variables over literals in styles.

- **Code style**:
  - Prefer existing libraries over custom complex code.
  - Keep components small and composable; extract hooks for logic.
  - Use explicit prop types and avoid `any`.

- **Routing and structure**:
  - Router config in `src/ui/react-router.config.ts` is the source of truth.
  - Co-locate component styles and tests with components when practical.

- **Package management and scripts**:
  - `src/ui/` is a bun workspace member (see root `package.json`).
  - Use `bun` instead of `npm` for all package operations.
  - Run formatting and linting from root directory:
    - `bun format:fix` - format all code
    - `bun lint` - run linting
    - `bun lint:fix` - auto-fix linting issues
  - Use `bun --cwd src/ui` for UI-specific commands when needed.

## Tauri

- Make sure to use secure Tauri APIs and plugins when possible.
- The Tauri MCP is available and can be used to interact with the app instead of browser MCPs.
